# Signature-Work-Portfolio
Write your "reflection" in either a"README.md" file in your root namespace (your-
github-name/README.md) or in a separate document
• In your reflection, link to and contextualize at least three GitHub projects that are
either your personal projects, course assignments, or other projects to which you
have contributed (but not RCDS)
• Your reflection will need to address at least one of the linked projects from a
domain-specific point of view
• Include project-level "README.md" files to describe the linked projects (I will count
each of the linked project "README.md" files that you wrote toward the reflection's
five page count requirement)


For my Signature Work Portfolio, I decided to showcase 4 different projects that I have worked on while studying at St. Thomas. Three of these projects were assignments from relavent courses,
and the other project was a task for my part time job. 

The first project that I want to touch on is an assignment that I completed while taking my Design & Programming course (CISC 230) with Dr. Yilek. As you can see in the [Uploading EpochConverter.java…]()
