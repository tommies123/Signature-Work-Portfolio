# Signature-Work-Portfolio
Write your "reflection" in either a"README.md" file in your root namespace (your-
github-name/README.md) or in a separate document
• In your reflection, link to and contextualize at least three GitHub projects that are
either your personal projects, course assignments, or other projects to which you
have contributed (but not RCDS)
• Your reflection will need to address at least one of the linked projects from a
domain-specific point of view
• Include project-level "README.md" files to describe the linked projects (I will count
each of the linked project "README.md" files that you wrote toward the reflection's
five page count requirement)
