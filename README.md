For my Signature Work Portfolio, I decided to showcase three different projects that I have worked on while studying at St. Thomas. Two of these projects were assignments from relavent courses,
and the other project was from a task for my part time job. 

The first project that I wanted to touch on was an assignment that I completed while taking my Design & Programming course (CISC 230) with Dr. Yilek. As you can see in the [Epoch Converter](EpochConverter.java) java 
file, I have some java code that converts a given date into epoch time. Additionally, the code outputs the current date's epoch time, and gives the user a random date from the year that they had entered. This lab was the 
first lab for the class, and was really one of the first times that I had been tasked with writing java code on my own. From this lab, I learned some of the basic coding techniques and learned out to properly 
outline code with comments. I have also found this code to be useful even after taking this course. There have been times where I have had to deal with epoch time, so having this code as a reference is very helpful. 

The second project that I wanted to highlight is from my Algorithms course (CISC 380) with Dr. Miracle. The homework comprised of two coding tasks. The first task can be located in the [Interleaver](Interleaver.java) java file
and the [InterleaverDriver](/HW3/InterleaverDriver.java) java file. This code implemented a dynamic programming solution using recursion to checking if a string is interleaving or not. Dynamic programming was a new topic for me, so 
this code taught me how to break up big problems into smaller parts to solve complicated questions. The second task for this assignment can be located in the [MaxSum](MaxSum.java) java file and the [MaxSumDriver](MaxSumDriver.java) 
java file. This code also implemented a dynamic programming solution, but aimed to solve the problem of finding a subarray with the maximum sum, given an array of numbers. This part of the assignment taught me how to simplify and 
condense code in order to reach an optimal runtime. Overall, the two parts in this assignment have helped me gain a much better understanding for recursion. I find this really important to understand since some of my recent job 
interviews have asked me to write code using recursion. 

The last project that I wanted to showcase was a java file that I created for my job at a local nonprofit.
