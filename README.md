For my Signature Work Portfolio, I decided to showcase three different projects that I have worked on while studying at St. Thomas. Two of these projects were assignments from relavent courses,
and the other project was from a task for my part time job. 

The first project that I wanted to touch on was an assignment that I completed while taking my Design & Programming course (CISC 230) with Dr. Yilek. As you can see in the [Epoch Converter](EpochConverter.java) java 
file, I have some java code that converts a given date into epoch time. The code also outputs the current date's epoch time, and gives the user a random date from the year that they had entered. This lab was the 
first lab for the class, and was really one of the first times that I had been tasked with writing java code on my own. From this lab, I learned some of the basic coding techniques and learned out to properly 
outline code with comments.

The second project that I wanted to highlight is from my Algorithms course (CISC 380) with Dr. Miracle. The homework comprised of two coding tasks. The first task can be located in the [Interleaver java file](Interleaver.java)
and the [InterleaverDriver java file](InterleaverDriver.java). This code implemented a dynamic programming solution to checking if a string is interleaving or not. Dynamic programming was a new topic for me, so this code
taught me how to break up big problems into smaller parts to solve complicated questions.
