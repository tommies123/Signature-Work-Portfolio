For my Signature Work Portfolio, I decided to showcase three different projects that I have worked on while studying at St. Thomas. Two of these projects were assignments from relevant courses,
and the other project was from a task for my part time job. 

The first project that I wanted to touch on was an assignment that I completed while taking my Design & Programming course (CISC 230) with Dr. Yilek. In the [Epoch Converter](EpochConverter.java) java file, you can find code 
that converts a given date into epoch time. Additionally, the code outputs the current date's epoch time, and provides the user with a random date from the entered year. This lab was the first lab 
for the class, and was really one of the first times that I had been tasked with writing java code on my own. From this lab, I learned some of the basic coding techniques and learned out to properly 
outline code with comments. I have also found this code to be useful even after taking this course. There have been times where I have had to deal with epoch time, so having this code as a reference is very helpful. 

The second project that I wanted to highlight is from my Algorithms course (CISC 380) with Dr. Miracle. The homework comprised of two coding tasks. The first task can be located in the [Interleaver](HW3/Interleaver.java) java file
and the [InterleaverDriver](HW3/InterleaverDriver.java) java file. This code implemented a dynamic programming solution using recursion to check if a string is interleaving or not. Dynamic programming was a new topic for me, so 
this code taught me how to break up big problems into smaller parts to solve complicated questions. The second task for this assignment can be located in the [MaxSum](HW3/MaxSum.java) java file and the [MaxSumDriver](HW3/MaxSumDriver.java) 
java file. This code also implemented a dynamic programming solution, but aimed to solve the problem of finding a subarray with the maximum sum, given an array of numbers. This part of the assignment taught me how to simplify and 
condense code in order to reach an optimal runtime. Overall, the two parts in this assignment have helped me gain a much better understanding for recursion. I find this really important to understand since some of my recent job 
interviews have asked me to write code using recursion. 

The last project that I wanted to showcase was a java file that I created for my job at a local nonprofit. One of my tasks as an IT Support Specialist at this nonprofit is to ensure that all computers on the network have been
updated and restarted regularly. There are currently around 90 different computers on our network, so this is usually a difficult and time consuming task to keep up with. In order to save some time, I came up with some methods 
that would take an excel or csv file, parse through the data, and return the computer names that had not been restarted for over 10 days. The code for this can be seen in the [uptimeCalc](uptimeCalc.java) java file. I usually run 
this file using my command line since it is pretty quick to do. This process has saved me a lot of time at work since I would usually be going through each computer and looking to see how long it had been running for. This code also
showed me how much I have learned while studying at St. Thomas. 

In conclusion, I believe that the work outlined in this portfolio has demonstrated my growth as both a student and computer programmer. The topics that I have learned in the classroom have prepared me for my future career and have 
made me more confident in the work that I produce. As I continue to explore this particular field of interest, I am excited about the opportunities ahead and plan to continue furthering my skills and knowledge in computer programming 
in order to make meaningful contributions to all future projects.
